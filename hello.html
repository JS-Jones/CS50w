<!--This is all work done through the Terminal in Mac using a system called GIT
Git like github is a way to keep track of your edits to scripts so that you can esily go back to other versions when you need it
You would start by cretaing a repository in github whch you then add as a folder to your mac
Use the commands git clone urllinkfromgithub to add the folder after navigating to your destination by using cd (child descentant) and ls (list of descendants)
After you use cd to get to that new folder, use touch nameofnewfile to create a new file
Use git add <filename> to add that file to your repository so it tracks when you make new changes
Use git commit -m "message" to save the repository
To push those changes back to github follow these:
git status to see what version your local one is on compared to the server
git push to commit those changes to github-->
